# The Mean Value Theorem

## Rolle's Theorem
- Let $f$ be a function that satisfies the following three hypotheses
  1. $f$ is continuous on the closed interval $[a, b]$
  2. $f$ is differentiable on the open interval $(a, b)$
  3. $f(a) = f(b)$
  - Then there is a number $c$ in $(a, b)$ such that $f'(c) = 0$

## The Mean Value Theorem
- Main use of Rolle's Theorem is in proving the mean value theorem
- Let $f$ be a function that satisfies the following hypotheses
  1. $f$ is continuous on the closed interval $[a, b]$
  2. $f$ is differentiable on the open interval $(a, b)$
  - Then there is a number $c$ in $(a, b)$ such that $$f'(c) = \frac{f(b) - f(a)}{b - a}$$ or equivalently, $$f(b) - f(a) = f'(c)(b - a)$$
- Mean value theorem tells us that such a number exists, but doesn't tell us how to find it
- The mean value theorem can be interpreted as saying that there is a number at which the instantaneous rate of change is equal to the average rate of change over an interval
- If $f'(x) = 0$ for all $x$ in an interval $(a, b)$, then $f$ is constant on $(a, b)$
  - Corollary: if $f'(x) = g'(x)$ for all $x$ in an interval $(a, b)$, then $f - g$ is constant on $(a, b)$; that is $f(x) = g(x) + c$ where $c$ is a constant
- First formulated by Joseph-Louis Lagrange
  - Lagrange points
